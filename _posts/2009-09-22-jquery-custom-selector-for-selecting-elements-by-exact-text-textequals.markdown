I just finished up writing another short blog post over on my company's development blog covering a jQuery custom selector I wrote to find elements based on their exact text.  There was a particular case where I needed to select elements in jQuery based on their exact text and not on whether the text contained a certain string.  That ruled out the possibility to use the built in contains() method.
