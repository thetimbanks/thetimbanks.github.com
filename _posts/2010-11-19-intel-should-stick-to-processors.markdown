I was taking some old clothes up to the local Goodwill to donate them and decided to browse around while I was there.  I found myself in the back of the store where they keep all the electronics, secretly hoping to find a good deal on something.  As I was skimming the less than desirable selection, something caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of the original PS3 controllers (see below), but after taking a closer look I actually started laughing out loud.  It is a wireless controller from Intel that is a god awful shape.  The controller is apparently part of a series of wireless devices from Intel as you can see on front of the box.

I am not sure Intel is ready for the game peripheral market just yet.
