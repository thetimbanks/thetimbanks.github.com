I set this site up a few months ago intending on making some posts, but never got around to doing it.  I would like to use this blog to post about interesting things I find related to technology.  The topic could cover programming, software, hardware, or anything else related to technology.  I may throw in a few personal posts here and there just to mix things up.

The first post should come shortly about a little jQuery extension I wrote for work.
