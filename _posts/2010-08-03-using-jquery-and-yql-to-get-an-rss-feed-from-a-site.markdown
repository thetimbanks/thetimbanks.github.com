I forgot to post a link to this earlier, but I wrote a blog post on using jQuery and YQL to get an RSS feed from a web site.  The code uses YQL to grab the content of the external site and then jQuery to find a link tag pointing to the location of the RSS feed.  This is similar to how Firefox displays the RSS feed icon in the address bar.
