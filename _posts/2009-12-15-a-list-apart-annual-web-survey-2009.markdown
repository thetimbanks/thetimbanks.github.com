Each year [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com) conducts a survey targeted towards people who consider themselves web professionals.  I have taken the survey each year and enjoy looking over the results to see how my current situation compares to everyone who takes the survey.  To take this year's survey, just go to [A List Apart's Survey Page](http://alistapart.com/articles/survey2009).  The survey only took me about 4 minutes to complete.

If you are interested in seeing the kind of data the survey collects, you can view [last year's results](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/findings/).
