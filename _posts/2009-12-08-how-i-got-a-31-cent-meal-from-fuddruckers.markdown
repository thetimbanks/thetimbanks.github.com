Occassionaly my co-workers and I like to go out to eat for lunch.  We tend to usually go to the same places in a rotation.  One of the places we frequently eat at is [Fuddruckers](http://fuddruckers.com/).  Some of you may be familiar with it from the movie [Idiocracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/) where it eventually ended up as "Buttfuckers" if I remember correctly.

Since I am pretty frugal with my money, I tend to try and use coupons whenever they are available.  My frequent visits to Fuddruckers had earned me a VIP card which was a reusable card that gave me 10% off my meal.  I always found 10% off a good deal and never bothered trying to find other coupons.

On this particular day though, I noticed a co-worker had gotten a coupon in his e-mail.  He mentioned he signed up for the "Fudd Club" and he received the email after signing up.  I proceeded to sign up as well and I too received the coupon in my e-mail.

After we both received the coupon, we took a look at the coupon and noticed that it didn't seem like a very good deal.  The coupon was for a 1/3 pound hamburger, fries, and a drink for "$7 flat".

We thought the meal was only about $7.50 or $8.00 to begin with and the savings of a dollar wasn't worth using the coupon since I usually don't get a soft drink anyway.  I decided to still print out the coupon and bring it anyway.

After arriving at Fuddruckers we immediately noticed that the meal the coupon was for was actually $6.99.  Basically the coupon was for 1 cent more than the actual meal cost.  I then approached the cashier and mentioned that I had a coupon for a hamburger meal and it was actually going to make me pay more than the meal cost.  The cashier responded immediately stating that the coupon should have read "$6 flat" instead of "$7 flat".  I figured with my 10% VIP card I could still get a meal for $5.40 plus tax.  Not too bad.

I went ahead and ordered the meal and presented by VIP card.  The cashier then looked up at me and said my total was 31 cents.  I thought I misheard her and asked her again how much.  She responded again, "31 cents".  I quickly gave the cashier a dollar and got my change.

When I got to my seat I started looking over the receipt to see how I managed to only pay 31 cents.  What happened was the cashier _took off_ $6 instead of charging me $6.  That essentially lowered the price down to $1.  Then the 10% off for my VIP card was taken off the $7 meal instead of the $1.  That lowered the total down to 30 cents.

I soon received my food and started enjoying the best 31 cent hamburger I have ever had.
