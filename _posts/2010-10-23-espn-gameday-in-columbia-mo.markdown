Since I am a big football fan and a big fan of the Missouri Tigers I was so excited to hear that ESPN's College GameDay would be headed to Columbia, MO for the first time ever.  With OU and Mizzou holding #1 and #11 ranking in the BCS poll, this game is huge for Missouri.  Not to mention it is Homecoming for Mizzou.  Below you will find some pics of the stage on Friday night before the GameDay broadcast along with a video where Lee Corso fakes the crowd out by putting on a Missouri Tigers helmet and then switching it with the OU mascot.

The crowd was huge and very loud.  After the live broadcast Chris Fowler and the other hosts turned around and mentioned that we were an "awesome, awesome crowd".  When I was listening on the radio I could barely hear the announcers talking over the crowd in the background.  I hope the enthusiasm continues into the stadium tonight.
